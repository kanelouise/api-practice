# README

This is a simple API tutorial (https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-build-an-api-with-ruby-on-rails-28e27d47455a) I followed to better understand the anatomy of an API. This API was created using Ruby on Rails and a PostgreSQL database. 

In order to test the functionality of this API, open a terminal window at the root, run `rails s` then in a browser, open `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/products/` and a list of products from the seeded database will appear. 

Again, this API was built for exploration, there is tons of room for building upon this project. I would be interested to approach this project with different web frameworks as well.
